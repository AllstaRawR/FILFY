# FILFY
The list itself is now out, but consider it in a beta state. It will work, and your saves shouldn't break as long as the version number starts with a 1.X.X. That said, future updates might break saves as I finish migrating to SkyPatcher. Once I am fully migrated to SkyPatcher, I will update to version 2.0+ if it does in fact break saves. You can see my current to-do list at the bottom and find any known issues inside of the Bug Tracker.

If you would like to see the general contents of the list, it is available at [Load Order Library](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/filfy-fantastically-integrated-load-order-for-you) for quick viewing without downloading.
